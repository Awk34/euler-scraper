## Digital root sums of factorisations

A composite number can be factored many different ways.  
For instance, not including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:

Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding together the digits of that number, 
and repeating that process until a number is arrived at that is less than 10.  
Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.

We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the individual factors of our number.<br>
 The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.

The maximum Digital Root Sum  of 24 is 11.<br>
The function mdrs(<var>n</var>) gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of <var>n</var>. So  mdrs(24)=11.<br>
Find &#x2211;mdrs(<var>n</var>) for 1 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 1,000,000.
