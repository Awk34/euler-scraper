##Poker hands

In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:

The cards are valued in the order:<br>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

The file, <a href="project/resources/p054_poker.txt">poker.txt</a>, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1&apos;s cards and the last five are Player 2&apos;s cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player&apos;s hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.

How many hands does Player 1 win?
