##Prime pair connection

Consider the consecutive primes <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 19 and <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = 23. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> whilst also being divisible by <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>.

In fact, with the exception of <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 3 and <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = 5, for every pair of consecutive primes, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> &gt; <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, there exist values of <i>n</i> for which the last digits are formed by <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>n</i> is divisible by <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>. Let <i>S</i> be the smallest of these values of <i>n</i>.

Find &#x2211; <i>S</i> for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 &#x2264; <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> &#x2264; 1000000.
