## Combinatoric selections

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, <sup>5</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 10.

In general,

It is not until <var>n</var> = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: <sup>23</sup>C<sub>10</sub> = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of &#xA0;<sup><var>n</var></sup>C<sub><var>r</var></sub>, for 1 &#x2264; <var>n</var> &#x2264; 100, are greater than one-million?
