##Digit factorial chains

The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:

1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:

169 &#x2192; 363601 &#x2192; 1454 &#x2192; 169<br>
871 &#x2192; 45361 &#x2192; 871<br>
872 &#x2192; 45362 &#x2192; 872

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,

69 &#x2192; 363600 &#x2192; 1454 &#x2192; 169 &#x2192; 363601 (&#x2192; 1454)<br>
78 &#x2192; 45360 &#x2192; 871 &#x2192; 45361 (&#x2192; 871)<br>
540 &#x2192; 145 (&#x2192; 145)

Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?
