##Singleton difference

The positive integers, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that <i>n</i> is a positive integer, the equation, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> &#x2212; <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> &#x2212; <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i>, has exactly one solution when <i>n</i> = 20:

13<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 10<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 7<sup>2</sup> = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of <i>n</i> below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of <i>n</i> less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
