## Convergents of e

The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.

The infinite continued fraction can be written, &#x221A;2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates that 2 repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>. In a similar way, &#x221A;23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].

It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for &#x221A;2.

Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for &#x221A;2 are:

What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,<br><i>e</i> = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2<i>k</i>,1, ...].

The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for <i>e</i> are:

The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10<sup>th</sup> convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.

Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100<sup>th</sup> convergent of the continued fraction for <i>e</i>.
