##Connectedness of a network

Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users:

The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record n are Caller(n) = S<sub>2n-1</sub> and Called(n) = S<sub>2n</sub> where S<sub>1,2,3,...</sub> come from the &quot;Lagged Fibonacci Generator&quot;:

For 1 &#x2264; k &#x2264; 55, S<sub>k</sub> = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k<sup>3</sup>] (modulo 1000000)<br>
For 56 &#x2264; k, S<sub>k</sub> = [S<sub>k-24</sub> + S<sub>k-55</sub>] (modulo 1000000)

If Caller(n) = Called(n) then the user is assumed to have misdialled and the call fails; otherwise the call is successful.

From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users X and Y are friends if X calls Y or vice-versa. Similarly, X is a friend of a friend of Z if X is a friend of Y and Y is a friend of Z; and so on for longer chains.

The Prime Minister&apos;s phone number is 524287. After how many successful calls, not counting misdials, will 99% of the users (including the PM) be a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?
