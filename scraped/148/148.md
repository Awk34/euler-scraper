##Exploring Pascal&apos;s triangle

We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal&apos;s triangle are divisible by 7:

However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of the 5050 entries are <i>not</i> divisible by 7.

Find the number of entries which are <i>not</i> divisible by 7 in the first one billion (10<sup>9</sup>) rows of Pascal&apos;s triangle.
