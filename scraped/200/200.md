## Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string &quot;200&quot;

We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, <var>p</var><sup>2</sup><var>q</var><sup>3</sup>, where <var>p</var> and <var>q</var> are distinct primes.<br>
For example, 200 = 5<sup>2</sup>2<sup>3</sup> or 120072949 = 23<sup>2</sup>61<sup>3</sup>.

The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.

Interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string &quot;200&quot; is 1992008.
