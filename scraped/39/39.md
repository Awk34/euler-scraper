##Integer right triangles

If <i>p</i> is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>}, there are exactly three solutions for <i>p</i> = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of <i>p</i> &#x2264; 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
