##Reciprocal cycles

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of <i>d</i> &lt; 1000 for which <sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>d</i></sub> contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
