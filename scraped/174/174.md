##Counting the number of &quot;hollow&quot; square laminae that can form one, two, three, ... distinct arrangements

We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square &quot;hole&quot; so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.

Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.

If <var>t</var> represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that <var>t</var> = 8 is type L(1) and <var>t</var> = 32 is type L(2).

Let N(<var>n</var>) be the number of <var>t</var> &#x2264; 1000000 such that <var>t</var> is type L(<var>n</var>); for example, N(15) = 832.

What is &#x2211; N(<var>n</var>) for 1 &#x2264; <var>n</var> &#x2264; 10?
