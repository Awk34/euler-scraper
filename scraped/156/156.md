## Counting Digits

Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like this:
<br>
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12....


Consider the digit <var>d</var>=1. After we write down each number <var>n</var>, we will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1). The first values for <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1), then, are as follows:

Note that <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1) never equals 3.
<br>
So the first two solutions of the equation <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1)=<var>n</var> are <var>n</var>=0 and <var>n</var>=1. The next solution is <var>n</var>=199981.

In the same manner the function <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>) gives the total number of digits <var>d</var> that have been written down after the number <var>n</var> has been written.
<br>
In fact, for every digit <var>d</var> &#x2260; 0, 0 is the first solution of the equation <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>)=<var>n</var>.

Let <var>s</var>(<var>d</var>) be the sum of all the solutions for which <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>)=<var>n</var>.
<br>
You are given that <var>s</var>(1)=22786974071.

Find  &#x2211; <var>s</var>(<var>d</var>) for 1 &#x2264; d &#x2264; 9.

Note: if, for some <var>n</var>, <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>)=<var>n</var>
 for more than one value of <var>d</var> this value of <var>n</var> is counted again for every value of <var>d</var> for which <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>)=<var>n</var>.
