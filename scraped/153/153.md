##Investigating Gaussian Integers

As we all know the equation <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>=-1 has no solutions for real <var>x</var>.
<br>
If we however introduce the imaginary number <var>i</var> this equation has two solutions: <var>x=i</var> and <var>x=-i</var>.
<br>
If we go a step further the equation (<var>x</var>-3)<sup>2</sup>=-4 has two complex solutions: <var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var>.
<br><var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var> are called each others&apos; complex conjugate.
<br>
Numbers of the form <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> are called complex numbers.
<br>
In general <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> and <var>a</var>&#x2212;<var>bi</var> are each other&apos;s complex conjugate.

A Gaussian Integer is a complex number <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> such that both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are integers.
<br>
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with <var>b</var>=0).
<br>
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with <var>b</var> &#x2260; 0 we call such integers &quot;rational integers.&quot;
<br>
A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var> if the result is also a Gaussian integer.
<br>
If for example we divide 5 by 1+2<var>i</var> we can simplify <img src="project/images/p153_formule1.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt=""> in the following manner:
<br>
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2<var>i</var>: 1&#x2212;2<var>i</var>.
<br>
The result is 
<img src="project/images/p153_formule2.gif" border="0" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle;">.
<br>
So 1+2<var>i</var> is a divisor of 5.
<br>
Note that 1+<var>i</var> is not a divisor of 5 because <img src="project/images/p153_formule5.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="">.
<br>
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (<var>a</var>+<var>bi</var>) is a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var>, then its complex conjugate (<var>a</var>&#x2212;<var>bi</var>) is also a divisor of <var>n</var>.

In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2<var>i</var>, 1 &#x2212; 2<var>i</var>, 2 + <var>i</var>, 2 &#x2212; <var>i</var>, 5}.
<br>
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:

For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: <img src="project/images/p153_formule6.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="">.

For 1 &#x2264; <var>n</var> &#x2264; 10<sup>5</sup>, &#x2211; s(<var>n</var>)=17924657155.

What is &#x2211; s(<var>n</var>) for 1 &#x2264; <var>n</var> &#x2264; 10<sup>8</sup>?
