## Triangle containment

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 &#x2264; <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> &#x2264; 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)<br><br>
X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using <a href="project/resources/p102_triangles.txt">triangles.txt</a>, a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand &quot;random&quot; triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.
