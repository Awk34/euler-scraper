Given the positive integers, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, <i>n</i>, for which the equation, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> &#x2212; <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> &#x2212; <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i>, has exactly two solutions is <i>n</i> = 27:

34<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 27<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 20<sup>2</sup> = 12<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 9<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 6<sup>2</sup> = 27

It turns out that <i>n</i> = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.

How many values of <i>n</i> less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?
