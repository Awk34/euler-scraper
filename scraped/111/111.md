##Primes with runs

Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:

1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111

We shall say that M(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an <i>n</i>-digit prime where <i>d</i> is the repeated digit, N(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the number of such primes, and S(<i>n</i>, <i>d</i>) represents the sum of these primes.

So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for <i>d</i> = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.

In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.

For <i>d</i> = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, <i>d</i>) is 273700.

Find the sum of all S(10, <i>d</i>).
