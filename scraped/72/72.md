##Counting fractions

Consider the fraction, <i>n/d</i>, where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are positive integers. If <i>n</i>&lt;<i>d</i> and HCF(<i>n,d</i>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> &#x2264; 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> &#x2264; 1,000,000?
