## Coloured Configurations

Consider graphs built with the units A: <img src="project/images/p194_GraphA.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="">
and B: <img src="project/images/p194_GraphB.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="">, where the units are glued along
the vertical edges as in the graph <img src="project/images/p194_Fig.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" alt="">.

A configuration of type (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>) is a graph thus built of <var>a</var> units A and <var>b</var> units B, where the graph&apos;s vertices are coloured using up to <var>c</var> colours, so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.<br>
The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type (2,2,6), in fact of type (2,2,<var>c</var>) for all <var>c</var> &#x2265; 4.

Let N(<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>) be the number of configurations of type (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>).<br>
For example, N(1,0,3) = 24, N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736.

Find the last 8 digits of N(25,75,1984).
