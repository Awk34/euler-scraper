##Large repunit factors

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(<i>k</i>) to be a repunit of length <i>k</i>.

For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11x41&#xD7;271&#xD7;9091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414.

Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(10<sup>9</sup>).
