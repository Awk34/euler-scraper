##Totient permutation

Euler&apos;s Totient function, &#x3C6;(<var>n</var>) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var> which are relatively prime to <var>n</var>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, &#x3C6;(9)=6.<br>The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so &#x3C6;(1)=1. 

Interestingly, &#x3C6;(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

Find the value of <var>n</var>, 1 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>7</sup>, for which &#x3C6;(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio <var>n</var>/&#x3C6;(<var>n</var>) produces a minimum.
