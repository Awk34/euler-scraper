##Prime power triples

The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:

28 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup><br>
33 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup><br>
49 = 5<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup><br>
47 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
