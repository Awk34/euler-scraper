## Square digit chains

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

44 &#x2192; 32 &#x2192; 13 &#x2192; 10 &#x2192; <b>1</b> &#x2192; <b>1</b><br>
85 &#x2192; <b>89</b> &#x2192; 145 &#x2192; 42 &#x2192; 20 &#x2192; 4 &#x2192; 16 &#x2192; 37 &#x2192; 58 &#x2192; <b>89</b>

Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
