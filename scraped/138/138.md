##Special isosceles triangles

Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, <i>b</i> = 16, and legs, L = 17.

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, <i>h</i> = &#x221A;(17<sup>2</sup> &#x2212; 8<sup>2</sup>) = 15, which is one less than the base length.

With <i>b</i> = 272 and L = 305, we get <i>h</i> = 273, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that <i>h</i> = <i>b</i> &#xB1; 1.

Find &#x2211; L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which <i>h</i> = <i>b</i> &#xB1; 1 and <i>b</i>, L are positive integers.
