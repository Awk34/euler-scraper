##Exploring the number of different ways a number can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2

Define f(0)=1 and f(<var>n</var>) to be the number of different ways <var>n</var> can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power no more than twice.

For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:

1 + 1 + 8<br>
1 + 1 + 4 + 4<br>1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4<br>
2 + 4 + 4<br>
2 + 8

What is f(10<sup>25</sup>)?
