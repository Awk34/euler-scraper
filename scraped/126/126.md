##Cuboid layers

The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring 3&#xA0;x&#xA0;2&#xA0;x&#xA0;1 is twenty-two.

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.

However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5&#xA0;x&#xA0;1&#xA0;x&#xA0;1 also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5&#xA0;x&#xA0;3&#xA0;x&#xA0;1, 7&#xA0;x&#xA0;2&#xA0;x&#xA0;1, and 11&#xA0;x&#xA0;1&#xA0;x&#xA0;1 all contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define C(<i>n</i>) to represent the number of cuboids that contain <i>n</i> cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.

It turns out that 154 is the least value of <i>n</i> for which C(<i>n</i>) = 10.

Find the least value of <i>n</i> for which C(<i>n</i>) = 1000.
