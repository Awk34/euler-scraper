## Coin partitions

Let p(<i>n</i>) represent the number of different ways in which <i>n</i> coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

Find the least value of <i>n</i> for which p(<i>n</i>) is divisible by one million.
