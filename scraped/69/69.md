## Totient maximum

Euler&apos;s Totient function, &#x3C6;(<i>n</i>) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than <i>n</i> which are relatively prime to <i>n</i>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, &#x3C6;(9)=6.

It can be seen that <i>n</i>=6 produces a maximum <i>n</i>/&#x3C6;(<i>n</i>) for <i>n</i> &#x2264; 10.

Find the value of <i>n</i> &#x2264; 1,000,000 for which <i>n</i>/&#x3C6;(<i>n</i>) is a maximum.
