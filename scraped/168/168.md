##Number Rotations

Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.<br>
It can be verified that 714285=5x142857.<br>
This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers <var>n</var>, 10 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>100</sup>, that have this property.
