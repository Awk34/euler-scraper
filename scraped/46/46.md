## Goldbach&apos;s other conjecture

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2x1<sup>2</sup><br>
15 = 7 + 2&#xD7;2<sup>2</sup><br>
21 = 3 + 2&#xD7;3<sup>2</sup><br>
25 = 7 + 2&#xD7;3<sup>2</sup><br>
27 = 19 + 2&#xD7;2<sup>2</sup><br>
33 = 31 + 2&#xD7;1<sup>2</sup>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
